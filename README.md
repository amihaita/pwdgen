# pwdgen - Password Generator
The purpose of this application was to test a locally installed artificial intelligence model. 80% is the original code, which was then corrected and small additions applied. The app works unexpectedly well.
Exe file was added. To run pwdgen.exe, the icon file pwdgen.ico must be in the same folder.
